		title: "Orthogonality and Graph Divergence Losses for Disentanglement in Generative AI Models (Under Review)",
		description:
			'As a ML Research Assistant at Geometric Media Lab, I worked with generative models where we aimed to design a deep generative model capable of capturing the geometry of underlying data manifolds, aiming to enhance image generation quality and offer controlled generation. The model would dissect the latent space into distinct representations for different attribute manifolds, making it possible to understand and manipulate these attributes independently.',

		description:
			"In my Internship as an AI intern I worked towards refining the Neural Radiance Field (NERF) algorithm for better 3D reconstruction from 2D images, resulting in an 8% boost in algorithm efficiency. I also developed a detailed 3D clothing dataset for human avatars in the Meta-verse and introduced a novel rendering technique to add textures to 3D models.",

		title: "MATLAB Simulation of Vacuum Power Brakes: A Cost-Efficient Approach",
		description:
			"During the COVID lockdown, I utilized my spare time to address a challenge in the automobile industry: testing vacuum power brakes efficiently using MATLAB. Traditional methods often incurred high costs due to inefficient results post-production. My approach used MATLAB's simulation capabilities to evaluate brake booster efficacy without physical testing. The outcome? A faster, 90% accurate testing method for vacuum power brakes. This work was later published in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) conference.",

		title: "Green Manufacturing: A CNC Machine Prototype from E-Waste",
		description:
			"In my undergraduate years, I delved into an prospective research revolving around the efficient utilization of E-waste. We designed a versatile CNC machine powered by the Arduino microcontroller. This innovative prototype, crafted primarily from repurposed materials like DVD drives, drive cabinets, and old scooter batteries, demonstrates its adaptability in tasks ranging from sheet cutting to welding. Not only does this research highlight the potential for minimizing E-waste, but its cost-effective construction also presents promising applications in industries requiring precision in automated cutting and welding. I'm proud to share that our research was recognized and published at the IIT BHU (IJSR) conference",
